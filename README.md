# ImageProcessingProject

## List mini project:
### 1, Shape Detection
        Using Contour Approximation method to find shape of object
### 2, Traffic Sign Detection
        Using HSV color and Contour to detect traffic sign (turn left, turn right, stop, ...)
### 3, Traffic Sign Regconition
        Using a simple CNN model to classify traffic sign
### 4, Skin Color Detection
        Apply a Logistic Regression with Regularization to segment skin from human body.
### 5, Object Detection with SIFT
        Using SIFT to detect a given similar object. 
### 6, Image Colorization
        Auto colorization gray image using DL, training on ImageNet dataset
### 7, Lane Segmentation
        Realtime segmentation detect lane on auto-driving car
### 8, Image to text (OCR)
        Optical Character Recognition using pretrained model and tesseract
### 9, Image Search Engine using HOG
        Using Histogram Oriented Gradient method to extract feature from image and find the best similar image
### 10, Face Detection using Haar Cascade
        Using Haar Cascade algorithm with specify feature on human face to dedect face from image.
